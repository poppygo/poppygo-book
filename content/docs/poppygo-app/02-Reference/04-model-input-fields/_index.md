# Content Model Confiration

For content managing PoppyGo App can create advanced forms to edit content. These
forms are configured in the _sukoh.json file_. The sukoh-file can be in YAML,
JSON or TOML-formatting. For sake of readability we use YAML for inline example
snippets in this reference.

## Model Input Fields

the main keys Singles, Collections and Partials can have fields definitions.
These are the building blocks for creating forms.
